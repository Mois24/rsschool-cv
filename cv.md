# About Me
I worked in the sales department in Belarus for seven years. But I want to develop myself, so I decided to move on. My goal is to be an exceptional Frontend developer. Recently, I've relocated to Montenegro and now Iâ€™m looking for my starting position to take off. 

P.S. If your company has a football team, I will be a great add on as I was professional football player. Except for football, I do extreme sports - skateboarding and snowboarding.
